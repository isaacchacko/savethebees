# My Personal Website!

Depending on when you see this, this repository is named "savethebees". There's no reason for this. It's just fun.

This is the (in-progress) 2nd iteration of my website. Meant to have more dynamic elements and is supposed to be more aesthetically pleasing. Hope you like it! Please peruse my website, there's a lot of love put into this and I would hate if an easter egg or two fell on deaf (blind) ears (eyes).
