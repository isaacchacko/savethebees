## Why was/is the repository called savethebees?

I initially made this repository with an intention to make a bee simulation through boids. But, after some time, I realized that my current simulation would look pretty *fly* as a website background.

## Fun Features

I aspire for this website to be (for the most part) autonomous, where when I grow, it grows with me. The following are lists of features currently implemented, as well as potential future features and features currently in development.

### Currently deployed
- a boid simulation playing in the background, one which I will later turn into its own website for users to have fun and play around with the variables themselves. 
- a "Now Playing" showcasing the current song playing, courtesy of the Spotify API
- a live look at my running mileage through the Strava API

### In Development
- LoL statistics

### Future Features
- a tracker of how many hours I've spent in Neovim
- a daily habit tile spread (akin to GitHub's), but for all of my habits
- a display of my pinned GitHub repositories, courtesy of GitHub API
