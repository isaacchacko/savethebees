# My Personal Website

Howdy! Have fun playing around with an interactive boid simulation, learn about my music tastes, and discover my other projects at [isaacchacko.co](https://isaacchacko.co)!

I made this website with **Next.js**, **Typescript**, **TailwindCSS**, **Redis Cloud Databases**, and **Vercel**.

## Why was/is the repository called savethebees?

I initially made this repository with an intention to make a bee simulation through boids. But, after some time, I realized that my current simulation would look pretty _fly_ as a website background.

## Fun Features

- a boid simulation playing in the background, one which I will later turn into its own website for users to have fun and play around with the variables themselves.
- a "Now Playing" showcasing the current song playing, courtesy of the Spotify API
- a live look at my running mileage through the Strava API

All in all, I aspire for this website to be (for the most part) autonomous, where when I grow, it grows with me.

Hope you liked learning about me, and always remember to save the bees!
